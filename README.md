# NumPy_COhPy_MarchPresentation
### *March 25, 2024 COhPy (The Central Ohio Python Users Group) Presentation on NumPy.*

NumPy is an open source library used for working with arrays. We will discuss why NumPy is so powerful and how NumPy relates to Pandas and Matplotlib.  We will learn easy to use mathematical functions and apply them to real life investment example scenarios. We will conclude the March session by applying our NumPy skills with an investment game. May the fastest programmer / investor win!
